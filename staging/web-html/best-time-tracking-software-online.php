                        <li><strong> Choose user-friendly time tracking tool:</strong> Encourage
                          employees to track their time using a tool or app that is easy and
                          convenient for them. This will help ensure that they use the tool
                          effectively and see first-hand the benefits of time tracking.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong> Respect employees privacy and personal needs:</strong> Assure
                          teams that time tracking will not micromanage them or track their every
                          move. Time tracking should only measure productive hours spent on
                          specific tasks or projects, not to monitor employee whereabouts or
                          activities.
