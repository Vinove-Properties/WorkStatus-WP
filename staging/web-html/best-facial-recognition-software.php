                    <h3 class="guide-question">1. How does the face recognition attendance system work? Why is it on rise?</h3>
                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>The face recognition attendance system works by comparing and validating the facial features of a person with the photo database of authorized personnel.The face recognition attendance system is on the rise because it's an efficient way to keep track of who's in the office and when they're there. It works by scanning employees' faces as they enter and exit the office, and then recording that information in a database.</p>
                      <p>The face recognition attendance system has a number of advantages over other forms of attendance tracking, such as time cards or ID cards. For one, it's more accurate than other methods; it can't be easily faked like a time card, and it can't be lost like an ID card. For another, it's more efficient than other methods; there's no need to fumble through cards or enter data into a computer terminal. And finally, it's more secure.</p>
                      <p>Other attendance tracking systems rely on physical security controls that are not always reliable. On the other hand, face recognition is a physical security control that works because it uses biometric data - something you are, instead of something you have.</p>

                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>There are a few advantages of the face recognition attendance system. For one, it's more accurate and efficient than other methods such as manual checking or fingerprint scanning. It also helps reduce time wasted by employees who have to sign in and out, and it can deter employee theft by making it more difficult for someone to claim they were not at work when they were. </p>
                      <p>Finally, a face recognition attendance system can provide detailed reports on employee attendance, which can be helpful for evaluating staff performance or tracking down absenteeism.</p>
                      <p>There are several disadvantages of using face recognition as a form of attendance tracking. First, the technology is not perfect and can be fooled by images or videos of a person's face. Second, many people are uncomfortable with the idea of being scanned or photographed without their knowledge or consent.</p>
                      <p>Besides, large-scale use of facial recognition could lead to mass surveillance and invasion of privacy. Finally, there are concerns that the technology could be used to unfairly target certain groups or individuals.</p>

                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>A face attendance system is a great way to keep track of employee attendance. generally, the system works by scanning the faces of employees as they enter and exit the building.</p>
                      <p>There are a few different ways to set up a face attendance system. One option is to use facial recognition software to scan employees' faces as they enter and exit. Alternatively, you can use CCTV cameras to capture images of employees as they come and go. You can then use software or manual labor to compare photos of employees against those in your employee database in order to track attendance.</p>
                      <p>Whichever method you choose, be sure to train your employees on how the system works and what they need to do in order to ensure accurate data collection. Have
                        them learn to stop what they're doing and smile for the camera when they enter the building, or teach them how to swivel their heads slightly in order to get images of both sides of their face. The more employees know about the system, the less likely it is that you'll have problems with attendance going forward.

                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>The facial recognition attendance system has a number of benefits. First, it eliminates the need for traditional punch cards or time clocks. This means that employees no longer have to waste time tracking down and punching a card, and employers no longer have to manage and track cards.</p>
                      <p>Second, the facial recognition attendance system is more accurate than traditional systems. It can accurately identify employees even if they are wearing hats or sunglasses, and it can't be fooled by someone else's card or badge.</p>
                      <p>Third, the facial recognition attendance system is more secure than traditional systems. It is virtually impossible to forge a face, so it is much less likely that someone will be able to cheat the system. This makes the system more reliable.</p>
                      <p>Finally, the facial recognition attendance system is much more affordable than traditional systems. While companies used to have to invest thousands of dollars in ID cards and reader systems for punch cards or time clocks, the facial recognition system just requires them to get their employees to download an app on their mobile phones. </p>

                          <p>A face recognition attendance system is a biometric system that uses facial recognition technology to identify individuals who have attended an event or meeting. The system scans the faces of everyone in attendance and compares them to a database of images that have been previously scanned and stored. If there is a match, the individual's name will be displayed on a screen or printed out as part of the attendance report.
                          </p>
                          <p>A face recognition attendance system can be used to verify the identity of attendees at events such as conferences, meetings, and classes, or to track the attendance of employees at places of business. The system can also be used to prevent unauthorized access to secure areas by tracking who has entered and exited certain locations.</p>

                          <p>Workstatus is the best facial recognition based attendance app because it is extremely accurate and very user-friendly.
                          </p>
                          <p>Workstatus uses the latest facial recognition technology to accurately identify employees as they arrive and leave the office. This information is then automatically uploaded to the cloud, so managers can keep track of employee attendance without having to tediously compile employee time sheets manually.</p>
                          <p>Workstatus is also extremely user-friendly. Employees simply have to open the app on their phone, and the app will automatically detect their face and log them in or out of work. There is no need for employees to remember complicated passwords or PINs – just open the app and you're good to go!. </p>
