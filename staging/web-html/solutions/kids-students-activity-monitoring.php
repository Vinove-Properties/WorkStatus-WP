                                          Students can also use Workstatus to keep track of their daily schedules. They can plan out each day in advance, or they can add events as they go. If a student has a paper due on Friday but doesn’t have enough time to work on it during the week, they can easily see how much time they need to spend each day until Friday so that they can finish on time.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                          Workstatus is an excellent tool for students. It helps them plan out their schedule, keeps track of how much time they spend on each project, and even provides reminders so that they don’t forget about any deadlines of their projects or assignments.
