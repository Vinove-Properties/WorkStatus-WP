                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>The main difference between productivity and activity tracking is that
                        productivity tracking focuses on the end goal. In contrast, activity
                        tracking is more concerned with the means to achieve that goal.
                      </p>
                      <p>Productivity tracking is about figuring out what work needs to be done to
                        achieve a specific goal and then measuring how effectively that work is
                        being done. On the other hand, activity tracking is more concerned with
                        recording all of the details of how a person goes about accomplishing their
                        work - what they do, when they do it, how long it takes them, etc.
                      </p>
                      <p>Activity trackers can be helpful for productivity tracking as well, but only
                        if they can accurately track all of the relevant data points.

                      resources according to need. We take advantage of several features since having
                      people manually report what projects they worked on at the end of each week was
                      ineffective (numerous individuals merely copied the same entries week after
                      week). Workstatus's project tracking is considerably more accurate than
                      self-reporting and easy to understand for employees. ”
