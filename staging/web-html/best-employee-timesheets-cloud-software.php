                                <p>Online timesheets can reduce data entry and storage costs because they allow
                                    employees to submit their time directly online. This means that there is no need for
                                    an employee to manually input their time into a timesheet, leading to mistakes and
                                    data entry errors.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, online timesheets can help reduce storage costs because they allow
                                    employees to store their timesheet information in the cloud. This means that
                                    employers do not need to maintain physical files containing employee timesheets,
                                    leading to increased storage space and cost.</p>

                                            track billable hours and payroll.</p>

                                        <p>Timesheets can have a lot of benefits for businesses and employees alike. For
                                            businesses, timesheets can help track employee productivity and identify
                                            areas for improvement. They can also be used to calculate wages and
                                            determine overtime payments.</p>
                                        <p>For employees, timesheets can help them keep track of the hours they've

                                        <p> To create a timesheet using Timesheet Software, you first need to identify
                                            what type of timesheet you want to use. There are three types of timesheets:
                                            daily, weekly, and monthly. </p>
                                        <p>Once you have chosen the type of timesheet you want to use, you will need to

                                            can be found on the internet or in Microsoft Word. </p>

                                            Additionally, timesheet software can help managers and supervisors identify

                                        <p> There are several ways to invoice using timesheet software. One way is to

                                            creating a new job, adding in the time worked, and then invoicing the client
                                            for that amount.</p>
                                        <p>Another way to invoice using timesheet software is to create an estimate for
                                            the client and then convert it into an invoice once approved. It will help

                                        <p> A Timesheet is nothing but a document that records an employee's number of
                                            hours worked. It is generally used to calculate the wages of employees.
                                            Employers use it to determine how much money to pay their employees for
                                            their work. Hourly workers rely on it to track their salaries and ensure
                                            they are paid correctly.</p>
                                        <p>Timesheets can be used in various ways, but most commonly, they are used for
                                            payroll purposes. They help employers track how many hours their employees
                                            worked, which can then be translated into an hourly wage rate. This
                                            information can then calculate each employee's total earnings for a given
                                            pay period. </p>
                                        <p>Workstatus is an app that automates timesheet tracking and payroll for small
                                            businesses. It allows employees to track the time they spend on each task
                                            throughout the day, which gets automatically exported to a timesheet that
                                            can be sent to the employer for approval. Once approved, the data is fed
                                            directly into the payroll system.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Workstatus is an excellent tool for small businesses that want to streamline
                                            their payroll process and ensure that everyone is accurately tracking their
                                            time spent on tasks. It's also helpful in preventing mistakes related to
                                            hours worked, overtime pay, etc.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Project management:</strong> Time tracking allows you to track
                                                the time spent on different tasks and projects, which can help you
                                                better estimate project costs and deadlines.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Payroll:</strong> By tracking employee hours worked, timesheets
                                                can help ensure that employees are paid accurately for the hours they

                                                - Employees can track their time accurately and submit their timesheets
                                                on time. This results in better organisation and responsibility within

                                                converted into invoices, making billing easier for both businesses and

                                            <li><strong>Tracking employee productivity</strong> - Businesses can use the
