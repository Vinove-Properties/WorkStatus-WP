                                        <p>You can easily implement GPS Tracking software in your company. You just need
                                            to first identify what type of solutions you need from it. </p>
                                        <p>Is it important for you to track its employees during work hours or also
                                            while they are at home? Is it important for employees to be able to track
                                            their own location within a certain time frame? </p>

                                            that he/she isn’t slacking off when working on something else, you can do so

                                        <p>With Workstatus, you can use GPS Tracking to keep track of your employees
                                            while they are on task. Here's how it works:</p>
                                        <p>When an employee is on duty, every time he or she logs into a Wi-Fi network,
                                            their precise location is reported back to you in real-time. This allows you
                                            to see exactly where they are and where they have been at any given moment
                                            throughout their workday or shift. </p>
                                        <p>If there is no Wi-Fi signal available, our proprietary technology will pick
                                            up signals from nearby cell towers and report them back to our servers so
                                            that we can continue to ensure that each asset's position is tracked
                                            accurately.</p>
                                        <p>Our technology also enables you to receive alerts when an asset has not
                                            checked in for a specified period of time, perhaps because one of your

                                        <p>A GPS tracking device transmits unique satellite signals to be received by a

                                            compute its time and rate of travel. </p>
                                        <p>These locations can then be pinpointed on a map or chart with relative ease
                                            by matching signals from at least three separate satellites. The data
                                            obtained from these devices are often ephemeris, which has become an

                                                With GPS tracking software, employers are able to keep an eye on each

                                                Managers can pinpoint their employees' exact locations at any given time

                                                When your employees are aware that they are being tracked, there is a

                                                Many people have no problem having their location tracked by services
                                                like Uber when they’re paying for it themselves, but workplace tracking
                                                goes too far. This means monitoring tools can be seen as nothing more
                                                than overbearing surveillance systems instead of helpful tools meant to
                                                boost efficiency and security.

                                            <li><strong>It can be risky</strong><br>
                                                Tracking technologies rely on satellite signals that their very nature
                                                can easily block. If a signal is lost, or if it’s a rainy day, or your
                                                manager loses his phone. Your employees could be at serious risk.

                                                The use of these technologies also puts an undue burden on your
                                                company’s IT department and drains valuable financial resources.

                                            <li><strong>Drain battery excessively</strong><br>
                                                GPS tracking software requires location services to be on, meaning your
                                                phone’s battery will drain faster than normal.
                                                <br><br>
                                                A good tracker can consume 15% of your battery per day, which means your
                                                battery will only last one day instead of three! If your phone is low on
                                                juice, there’s no way to access any information or help until it gets a
                                                full charge.

                                            these GP solutions are being implemented extensively and bring in measurable

                                                The logistics industry involves shipping goods and logistics management.
                                                GPS tracking software helps them track their shipping trucks/vehicles on
                                                a map to get real-time delivery information to manage their logistics

                                                This is the best option for Logistics Companies, who ship products and
                                                manage the transportation of people & goods worldwide.

                                                travelling easier and safer. People may now book a taxi from their

                                                Bike renters, for example, can be informed about when a bike has been
