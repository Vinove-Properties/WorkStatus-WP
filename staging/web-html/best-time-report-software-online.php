                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>Detailed time reports are a way to track the amount of time you spend on
                        various tasks throughout the day. They can be helpful for identifying where
                        you may be able to save time or make changes to your routine in order to
                        optimise your productivity.
                      </p>
                      <p>There are a number of different software tools that can help you create
                        detailed time reports and many of them are free or have free versions. One
                        popular option is Workstatus. Each tool works a little bit differently, but
                        they all track the amount of time you spend on various tasks and then
                        generate reports that show how much time you spent on each task over a
                        given period of time.
                      </p>
                      <p>Some of these software tools work by tracking your activity using a special
                        timer that runs in the background while you work. Others require you to
                        manually start and stop timers whenever you begin or end work on particular
                        activities. The one software we would recommend is Workstatus.
                      </p>
                      <p>Unlike traditional time reporting apps that are confined to just entering
                        the working hours, Workstatus enables your employees to track time spent on
                        any activity related to work. Workstatus makes the entire productivity
                        workflow simple and efficient for both the employer as well as employees.
                        It empowers your workforce with intelligent ways to track and monitor work
                        time and progress. Along with real-time reporting, you will enjoy the

                    <h3 class="guide-question">2. Why do you need a detailed time report in an
                      organisation?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>First and foremost, you need detailed time reports to see whether your
                        employees are working as expected and if not, why. The goal of this is
                        mainly for managers to be able to spend their resources adequately. Each
                        employee should be assigned the right amount of tasks, depending on his/her
                        knowledge and capability. In a perfect world, every task will require just
                        as much time as needed by an employee, but that's rarely the case since
                        each worker has different skills and expertise.
                      </p>
                      <p>In order to determine how much work should be allocated between employees
                        from various departments, it is often useful to have a detailed breakdown
                        of everyone's daily activity level. This will show how many hours were
                        spent on doing certain types of work and over time this will lead to a
                        better understanding of how the employees divide their own labour between
                        different tasks.
                      </p>
                      <p>This method also allows you to identify each employee's strengths and
                        weaknesses in order to assign them the right training (if necessary). If an
                        employee is allocated mainly administrative tasks, he/she can be trained in
                        software development so that when another worker leaves, your company hires
                        only one person for two rather than two for two. 
                      </p>
                      <p>For example, there is a marketing team and an IT team in your organisation.
                        The marketing team's work contains mostly public relations activities while
                        the IT department’s work consists of programming and maintaining servers.
                        There are several reasons why these teams should collaborate: both require
                        knowledge about customers' needs and problems in order to design a product
                        or a service. With proper communication, the marketing team can gather
                        real-time information from the customers while the IT team analyzes this
                        data and formulates insights which will contribute to work efficiency.
                      </p>
                      <p>In order for these two teams to collaborate effectively, they must share
                        detailed time reports across departments on a regular basis. This way both
                        managers of each department can get a deeper understanding of current
                        problems and possible new business opportunities.
                      </p>
                      <p>Additionally, if an employee is performing at his/her highest capacity it's
                        easier for him/her to find solutions when faced with problems since he/she
                        will know exactly what tasks he/she can leave out in order to solve
                        unforeseen issues without delaying things too much. Finally, it is easy to
                        notice when an employee is overloaded. Time reports will show whether or
                        not this is the case, enabling you to take the necessary steps (i.e. hire
                        new people) to fix it before it's too late.

                          can be used to see how much time individual team members worked on
                          specific tasks or projects over a period of time-a week or a month.
                          This report shows how much time each person spent on all tasks assigned
                          to them in the selected date range. The Time & Activity Report also
                          records the amount of billable vs non-billable work that occurred
                          during the date range. You can even determine which projects are

                    </h3>
                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>Real-time online time reporting is important because it gives employers a
                        way to track how much time their employees are spending on the job. This
                        information can be used to improve workflows and make sure that employees
                        are using their time efficiently.
                      </p>
                      <p>It can also help employers identify areas where they may need to make
                        changes in order to improve employee productivity. For example, if an
                        employer sees that a certain employee is spending a lot of time on social
                        media websites, they may decide to restrict access to those websites during
                        work hours.
                      </p>
                      <p>Employees should also appreciate the importance of real-time online time
                        reporting, as it can help them stay accountable for their work hours. By
                        knowing how much time they're spending on each task, employees can make
                        sure they're focusing on the right projects at the right times. This can
                        help them become more productive and make a greater impact with their work.
                      </p>
                      <p>Real-time online time tracking solutions also provide employees with a
                        simple way to monitor how much time they spend on each project, which can
                        make it easier for them to set deadlines for a project. 
                      </p>
                      <p>In addition, real-time online time reporting provides managers with a
                        complete picture of how their team members are allocating their time
                        throughout the day, enabling them to give employees feedback that helps
                        improve efficiency.

                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>Some data-points that managers can get from Workstatus reports include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Employee hours worked</li>
                        <li>Total hours worked per day/week/month</li>
                        <li>Overtime hours worked</li>
                        <li>Paid time off Hours taken</li>
                        <li>Break and lunch times taken </li>
                      </ul>
                      <ul class="listype">
                        <li><strong>Employee hours worked:</strong> The number of hours a person
                          has worked in a given work week. This allows managers to keep track of
                          employees and ensures that they are getting the hours they're being
                          paid for.<br>
                          <br>
                          By analysing the data on employee hours worked, managers can determine
                          whether or not an employee is regularly staying beyond their allotted
                          working hours - which could indicate that additional support is
                          required. For example, if an employee only works 8 hour days but
                          regularly logs 12-hour days, there may be too much work assigned to
                          this individual or it may be necessary to hire another worker.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Total Hours Worked:</strong> The total number of hours a person
                          has worked over a given period of time (such as one month). By
                          comparing these numbers with the corresponding pay scale, managers can
                          easily determine whether an employee is being paid correctly.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Overtime Hours:</strong> Any hours worked outside a regular
                          work day. For example, if a person starts work at 9 am and doesn't
                          leave until 6 pm but continues to work after that time for another hour
                          - they have worked 1 hour of overtime.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Paid Time Off (PTO):</strong> The total number of hours accrued
                          in PTO by employees within a given period of time. This allows managers
                          to keep track of how much time off has been taken by their team - which
                          may be useful in scheduling additional help during the busiest times or
                          when full coverage is not possible with existing staff.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Break Times:</strong> Data on break times taken by a person
                          during a given week. This information can be helpful to managers when
                          it comes to scheduling shifts and managing workloads.

                          It can be difficult for business owners to know exactly how much time
                          their employees are spending on tasks. This is because, even if you ask
                          your employees to record the amount of time that they spend on specific
                          tasks, they will often forget or overlook doing so. This means that
                          it's just not possible for employers to completely keep track of how
                          much time their employees are spending on certain activities.<br><br>
                          However, detailed time reporting software Workstatus can help employers
                          in this regard. By using Workstatus, you can see exactly how long each
                          employee has spent working on each task during a given period of
                          time.<br><br>
                          For example, say an employee spends 30 minutes on break and 30 minutes
                          making revisions to a website copy during one particular day. You can
                          then use Workstatus to create a report that reflects this. This tool
                          also allows you to track the percentage of working time your staff
                          spends on specific tasks, which can be helpful.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Workstatus detailed time reporting software can help you to

                          Even if you are regularly asking your employees to record their
                          individual task times, it's still not easy for managers to understand
                          exactly what is going on with their business processes.These processes
                          are often too complicated, making it difficult for managers to make
                          sense of them.<br><br>
                          However, Workstatus can help with this issue as well by allowing
                          employers to monitor process activities over time. For example, say an
                          employee is spending significant amounts of money each month on tasks
                          that aren't bringing in any revenue. You can use Workstatus to identify
                          this, allowing you to adjust your resource allocation accordingly.

                          activities of client work, then it's likely that you'll want some kind
                          of system that allows you to process these details more effectively.
                          This information will come in many different forms, including but not
                          limited to email communications, phone calls ,and meetings . Using

                      reporting software?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>The advantages of time reporting software are as follows: </p>
                      <ul class="listype">
                        <li>Time reporting software provides standardised data for usage in
                          reports. Time reporting software is advantageous because it presents
                          clear, concise data that can be easily utilised to determine standard
                          operating procedure, budgetary expectations and project completion
                          times.<br><br>
                          This information all helps managers to work towards the organisation's
                          goals by providing plans of action with regard to how much time should
                          be spent on particular tasks or projects so as not to waste resources.
                          It also gives employees an idea of what is expected of them on both a
                          day-to-day basis and long-term, which assists them in prioritising work
                          throughout the day.
                        </li>
                        <li>Employees can use their time to prioritise projects rather than time
                          spent. Another advantage of time reporting software is that it allows
                          employees to focus their efforts on prioritising projects rather than
                          having to keep track of how much time is spent on each one. This type
                          of software therefore allows employees to be more efficient with their
                          work hours because they can easily determine what needs to be done
                          first without constantly looking at the clock or tracking how many
                          hours they spend working on any particular task.
                        </li>
                        <li>Managers do not have to go through an extensive process of gathering or
                          approving timesheets . Managers are able to save a great deal of time
                          because there is no need for them to collect timesheets. There tends to
                          be less errors in the data entry if managers do not directly oversee
                          the process of filling out timesheets.
                        </li>
                        <li>Time reporting software is advantageous because it is typically
                          user-friendly and easy to install and use. For example, many programs
                          are designed in a way that allows employees, or even managers if
                          applicable, to easily clock in and out when they begin their shifts as
                          well as when they are finished.<br><br>
                          They can also track task details throughout the day by updating
                          statuses on certain projects so team members are aware of where work
                          stands without continually needing input from one another. Finally,
                          managers and employees alike can receive reports at the end of each
                          week or specific time period detailing where their time has been spent.
                        </li>
                        <li>Time reporting software helps provide accurate budgetary data to upper
                          management as well as other individuals involved in funding projects,
                          such as investors or clients. This data assists those who might not be
                          familiar with the process because it breaks down tasks into smaller
                          pieces and allows them to see exactly what is being done and how much
                          it should cost to complete each task along the way.

                      </ul>
                      <p>However, time reporting software can have certain disadvantages too:</p>
                      <ul class="listype">
                        <li>The software may lack information about project milestones, potentially
                          leading to errors on the back end. This might not seem like a big deal,

                          reported in order to determine how much money should be invested into
                          certain tasks or projects, they need to have an adequate understanding
                          of how far along each task is before drawing conclusions about
                          investment amounts.<br><br>
                          This also applies to clients who might need accurate information
                          regarding what is being done in order to make sure their expectations
                          are within reason. It can therefore be somewhat difficult for managers
                          or other stakeholders outside of the day-to-day work environment to
                          comprehend the process if they are receiving data strictly from time
                          reporting software rather than having more detailed information.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the software is not adapted to suit each employee's workflow, there
                          may be errors when it comes to reporting accurate data. If this step
                          fails, then inaccurate data will likely result and managers will have
                          no way of knowing if anything reported has any validity at all.
                        </li>
                        <li>Another possible drawback is that managers can potentially make
                          numerous errors while inputting timesheet data into the system because
                          they are only human, after all. Additionally, even when managers are
                          inputting the data directly into the system themselves, they might not
                          have the most current updates on certain milestones within a project
                          because of their own absence from the process for whatever reason. This
                          can lead to inaccurate reports being distributed to upper level
                          management or other stakeholders involved in funding projects.<br><br>

                          <p>Workstatus is the best detailed timesheet reporting app because it
                            offers several features that help businesses track employee time
                            and attendance. For example, Workstatus allows users to create
                            custom reports based on the data they need, filter data to see
                            specific information and export data into a variety of formats for

                            tasks are taking the most time and identify areas where employees
                            could be more productive.
                          </p>
                          <p>3. Billing clients correctly- By tracking the amount of time spent
                            on each task, businesses can invoice their clients correctly for
                            the services they provide. This can help to avoid misunderstandings
                            down the line.
