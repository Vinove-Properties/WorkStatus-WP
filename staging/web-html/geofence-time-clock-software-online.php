                  <p>Geofencing employee tracking is a great way to manage and monitor employee productivity.

                  <p>When you know how much exact time is spent at a client location, you can invoice clients accurately for all billable hours. Geofence time tracking can help by allowing you to track the exact hours your employees are working each day at the geofenced location. This data can be used to ensure that employees are being paid for all hours worked and neither they are working unauthorised overtime nor clients are underbilled. All this keeps payment-related hassles at bay and boosts profitability.</p>

                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>Geofencing software is a valuable business tool because it enables companies to track the movement of their employees in real-time. With geofencing software, businesses can see where their employees are at all times and can receive alerts if an employee leaves or enters a designated job site. This allows businesses to keep track of their employees' whereabouts and ensure that they are not wasting time travelling or loitering when they should be working.

                      <p>Geofencing can be used in all kinds of businesses and industries, particularly those that have a mobile workforce. For example, geofencing can be used to track employees' whereabouts and ensure they are where they are supposed to be.</p>

For example, a restaurant could use geofencing to send customers special offers when they are near the restaurant. Geofencing can also be used for marketing research purposes, such as understanding customer behaviour around specific locations.</p>

                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>Geofencing is a technique that uses the global positioning system (GPS) to define a virtual boundary around a real-world location (job site). Once the boundary is set, actions can be taken when an employee enters or exits the area. For example, you could send a text message to an employee when they leave for the day, or receive an alert when someone doesn’t show up at work.</p>
                      <p>GPS tracking, on the other hand, is the process of recording the movements of employees using GPS receivers. This data can then be used to track their location and movement over time. GPS tracking is often used to ensure employees are where they're supposed to be.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <div class="guide-answer">
                      <p>There are pros and cons to geofencing apps. On the pro side, geofencing can be used for tracking employee movements and improving efficiency. For example, if a company knows that its employees tend to spend a lot of time slacking off during breaks, it can adjust their work schedules or provide them with incentives to stay more productive. </p>
                      <p>On the con side, geofencing can also be used for less scrupulous purposes. For example, employers could use it to micro-manage their employees by tracking them each time; this may become annoying to employees who don’t like to work under a lot of supervision. So, while there are obvious benefits to using a geofencing app, there are certain downsides that employers need to be aware of.</p>

                          <p> Workstatus is the best geofenced time tracking app because it allows employers to track employee location and worked hours in real-time.
                          </p>
                          <p>Workstatus enables employers to see when their employees arrive at and leave their job location, how long they work each day, which routes they take, and what sites they visit. The app also tracks break times and sends notifications when employees are late or leave work early. This allows employers to ensure that their employees are following the correct work schedule and working the required hours.</p>

                          <p>Usually not. Geofencing relies on GPS tracking to work, so if the GPS tracking is turned off or not working for some reason, then the geofencing feature will not be able to function either.
                          </p>
                          <p>That said, there are some alternatives to GPS tracking that can be used for geofencing purposes, such as cell tower triangulation. However, these alternatives are not as accurate as GPS tracking and can be less reliable. As a result, if you're looking to use geofencing for employee tracking purposes and want to make sure that it works accurately and reliably, then it's best to keep GPS tracking turned on.</p>

                          <p>Yes, geofencing can be an effective way to monitor your remote workers. By setting up a virtual perimeter around a designated area, you can receive real-time notifications whenever an employee enters or exits the area. This can be helpful for ensuring that employees are staying on task and not wasting time away from the office.
                          </p>
                          <p>Additionally, geofencing can also be used for accurate employee tracking. By tracking the movements of your employees throughout the day, you can get a better understanding of how they're spending their time and see where there might be room for improvement. Overall, geofencing is a powerful tool that can help you improve your workflow and keep your employees productive.</p>

                          <p>There are a few different ways to implement a geofencing tracker. One way is to use the location services on employees' phones to track their movements. Another way is to use beacon technology to track employees' locations. There are also companies that offer tracking services through GPS or RFID tags.
                          </p>
                          <p>The most important thing is to make sure that you are compliant with all privacy laws in your area. Make sure you get consent from employees before tracking them, and make sure that you store and dispose of data properly.</p>

                    </h3>

                          <p> There is no clear consensus on this topic. Some experts believe that geofencing apps drain mobile batteries quickly because they use a lot of battery power in order to track a user's location. Others believe that this type of app does not use significantly more battery power than other types of apps.
                          </p>
                          <p>At any rate, it's a good idea to keep your phone's battery charged as much as possible, when you use geofencing apps. You can do this by using an app like Battery Saver or by keeping your phone in aeroplane mode when you're not using it.
