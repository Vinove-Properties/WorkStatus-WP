          <p>“We started using Workstatus sometime back. It has given a good amount of improvement in productivity of our employee. We are able to track what they do and how much time they spend on each of our project. It gives us clarity on which project we need to spend more time and whether they are spending right amount of time over the project as well. We are also able to track if anyone is tampering with productivity and time. As a productivity tracker, Workstatus is really good. It has a good support team that resolved all our technical issues in no time. We are looking for a long term association with Workstatus.”</p>
