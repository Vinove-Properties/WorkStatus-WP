### Database Schema for Lead Storage
   The system maintains separate tables for legitimate leads, spam leads, and blocked emails.

   Table : calendly_events store all the calendly event id for preventing the lead duplicacy
   ```sql
   -- Contact form submissions
    CREATE TABLE `calendly_events` (
    `event_id` varchar(255) COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci NOT NULL,
    `processed_at` timestamp NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

   Table : ws_survey_data store all the Survey data
   ```sql
   -- ws_survey_data storage of Survey - data 
    CREATE TABLE `ws_survey_data` (
    `ID` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `survey_id` bigint NOT NULL,
    `email` varchar(200) COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci NOT NULL,
    `data` longtext COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci NOT NULL,
    `created_at` datetime NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`ID`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

   ***Visitor Tracking (ipinfo_logs)***
   Tracks visitor IP addresses and geolocation data using the IPINFO API.

    `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `ip` varchar(200) NOT NULL,

### HTML Project Structure

We have developed two versions of the HTML structure, located in: /workstatus-html

Current Active Version
We are currently using Version 2.0, which can be found at: /workstatus-html/version-2.0 

Project Styling & Assets

This project is styled using SCSS (a CSS preprocessor) and follows a structured asset management approach. All related files are stored in: /workstatus-html/version-2.0/assests

Directory Breakdown:

├── version-2.0/assests
├── ├── css (Compiled CSS files)
├── ├── files (All Include Files)
├── ├── fonts  (Using "Lexend Deca" (sans-serif) in 400, 500, 700 weights)
├── ├── footer-images (Footer-related images)
├── ├── images (General images used in the project)
├── ├── js (JavaScript files)
├── ├── scss (Source SCSS files for styling)

├── common   (Contains shared component files used across the project)
├── dev-images  (Temporary images used during development)


SCSS Folder Structure

SCSS Folder Structure & Management
In the SCSS folder, we have separated styles for different sections into individual SCSS files for better organization. Instead of manually importing each file, we manage styles using a centralized _default.scss file.

/workstatus-html/version-2.0/assests/scss
├── 📄 _default.scss (Includes all SCSS files using @import "_default"; to centralize imports)
├── 📄 _menu-v4.scss (Header section styling)
├── 📄 _white-menu.scss (Header section with white background styling)
├── 📄 _footer-section.scss (Footer section styling)
├── 📄 _cta-section.scss (Button styles for the project)
├── 📄 _form-default.scss (Form elements styling)


With this approach, _default.scss acts as a single point of inclusion, allowing us to maintain modularity and streamline SCSS file management

The SCSS and CSS folders are kept separate within: /workstatus-html/version-2.0/assests. For compiling SCSS into CSS, we use the Koala App.
